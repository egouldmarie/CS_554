> The program `smlffact` (previously posted) computes factorials.
> However, it produces incorrect results, even for modest input values,
> because of numerical overflow. Here are two programs that produce
> correct results to at least 100000!. 
> 
> A slow program: `factorial-program-0.um`
> > 
> A fast program: `factorial-program-10.um`
> 
> Use the following commands to time your emulator:
> 
> `echo 500 | time emulator factorial-program-0.um`
> 
> and
> 
> `echo 10000 | time emulator factorial-program-10.um`
> 
> As before, report results for both b146-46.cs.unm.edu and
> risc-machine-2.cs.unm.edu.
