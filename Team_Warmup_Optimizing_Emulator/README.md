## Overview

instead of taking our fastest emulator, we focused on an emulator
in C++ that was not even quite completing the sandmark.um criterion …

got that working to be able to run sandmark, with an initial execution
time on the b146-46.cs.unm.edu machine of approx 3 mins, 40 secs.

gradual improvements …
