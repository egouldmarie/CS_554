# CS 554 (2025 Fall)

</br>

Repository for storing, sharing, and collaborating on code used and
constructed by the "Raspberry Pi" compiler project group (Gould,
Rowe, Shao, & Craft) for CS 554 (Compiler Construction, 2025 Fall,
instructor Darko Stefanovic) at the University of New Mexico.

<br/>

Assignments and folders for assignment content proceed in the following
order:

<br/>

### (1) Team_Warmup_Benchmarking

<br/>

An initial team exercise, in part designed to compare performance
of the CS department's b146-46 and risc-machine-2 machines, but also
intended to provide some impetus to project group members to begin
working together and develop some useful means of communication for
future group project work. The explicit assignment was to compare the
performance of various workloads between risc-machine-2.cs.unm.edu
and b146-46.cs.unm.edu machines and produce a report (PDF file), with
at least one workload per team member.

<br/>

### (2) Team_Warmup_Optimizing_Emulator

<br/>

The assignment was to put together the best ideas from the team
members' solutions, and brainstorm to further improve the um emulator
generated during the earlier homework exercises, then test and report
on the performance of the emulator for sandmark on both the b146 and
risc-v machines. Our work focused on working out some remaining bugs
in one of our emulators in C++ and then working on refinements to
bring down its sandmark execution time.

<br/>

### (3) Team_Warmup_Factorial

<br/>

In the team factorial-related work, the assignment was to test and
report on the performance of the emulator on two newer factorial-
computing programs, on both the b146 and risc-v machines.
